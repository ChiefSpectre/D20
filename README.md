# D20
 College project composed by: Myself, and three others.
 The purpose of this project is to provide a simplified solution to the D&D5e Roll20 character sheet experience. Roll20 is not affiliated with this project. 
 We propose an offline solution that enables users to store, update, and edit their sheets without relying on a network connection.
 Features of this program maybe adjusted as time goes on, depending on what circumstances may come.
